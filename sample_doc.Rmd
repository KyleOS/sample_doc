## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Julia

This is some Julia with `JuliaCall`:

```{julia}
a = sqrt(2)  # the semicolon inhibits printing

println("Hello Julia world!")

```

## Shell (bash)

Try out some shell script.

```{bash}

ls

```


## Table rendering

Some table rendering with `modelsummary` and `huxtable`. These don't show up great when rendering as .md because they generate html objects.

```{r}
library(modelsummary)

mod1 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris)

modelsummary(mod1)

```

```{r}
library(huxtable)

huxreg(mod1)

```
